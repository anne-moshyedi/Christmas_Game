# Christmas_Game
This is a Christmas themed game created in Python.

## The Story
It was the night before Christmas, and up in the sky, the wind was blowing, and the obstacles were stirring. <br/>
Santa was on his way to deliver presents around the World, when he hit some turbulence. The cookies he was saving up flew from his sleigh and the presents he was going to deliver scattered throughout the sky. Your job is to guide Santa through the night and help him collect all the lost presents. But look out! The Grinch is out and about, hoping to steal Christmas and all the lost presents. Jack Frost is also a danger in the sky, looking to bring Santa down with his ice. Remember that the cookies give Santa the fuel he needs to survive! How many presents can you save before the night ends or before villains ruin Christmas?
